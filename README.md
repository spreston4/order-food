## Description

Order Food is a mock front end application for a restaraunt's ordering service. Customers can browse the restaraunt's menu and add items to their cart. Customers can view their cart at anytime to see all items that have been placed in the cart, and the total amount of their order. Customers can adjust the quantity of items from their cart, or choose to empty their cart alltogether. After placing their order, customers are given the option of clearing their cart contents, or leaving items in their cart for easy reordering.
